=== WAN Batch Publisher Implementation

Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise Edition offers the WAN batch publisher implementation for WAN replication.

As you see in the above configuration examples, this implementation is specified simply by using
the `batch-publisher` element (in the declarative configuration) or the `WanBatchPublisherConfig`
class (in the programmatic configuration) when defining a WAN replication publisher.

The WAN batch publisher transmits WAN events (map and cache updates) between clusters in batches. It waits until:

* a pre-defined number of replication events are generated, (see the <<batch-size, Batch Size section>>)
* or a pre-defined amount of time is passed (see the <<batch-maximum-delay, Batch Maximum Delay section>>).
