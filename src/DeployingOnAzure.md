## Deploying On Microsoft Azure


You can deploy your Hazelcast cluster onto a Microsoft Azure environment. For this, your cluster should make use of Hazelcast Discovery Plugin for Microsoft Azure. You can find information about this plugin on its GitHub repository at [Hazelcast Azure](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-azure).

For information on how to automatically deploy your cluster onto Azure, please see the [Deployment](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-azure/blob/master/README.md#automated-deployment) section of [Hazelcast Azure](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-azure) plugin repository.
