![image](images/Plugin.png)

Hazelcast supports EC2 auto-discovery. It is useful when you do not want to provide or you cannot provide the list of possible IP addresses. This discovery feature is provided as a Hazelcast plugin. Please see its own GitHub repo at <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-aws" target="_blank">Hazelcast AWS</a> for information on configuring and using it.
