### Using the Scripts In The Package

When you download and extract the Hazelcast ZIP or TAR.GZ package, you will see 3 scripts under the `/bin` folder which provide basic functionalities for member and cluster management.

The following are the names and descriptions of each script:

- `server.sh` / `server.bat`: Starts a Hazelcast member with default configuration in the working directory.
- `stop.sh` / `stop.bat`: Stops the Hazelcast member that was started in the current working directory.
- `cluster.sh`: Provides basic functionalities for cluster management such as getting and changing cluster state, shutting down cluster or forcing the cluster to clean its persisted data and make a fresh start.

Please refer to the [Using the Script cluster.sh section](#using-the-script-cluster-sh) to learn the usage of this script.
