## Deployment Types


Basically, Hazelcast can be deployed in two types: as a Peer-to-Peer cluster or Client/Server cluster.

If you have an application whose main focal point is asynchronous or high performance computing and lots of task executions, then Peer-to-Peer deployment is the most useful. In this type, nodes include both the application and data, see the below illustration.

If you do not prefer running tasks in your cluster but storing data, you can have a cluster of server nodes that can be independently created and scaled. Your clients communicate with these server nodes to reach to the data on them. See the below illustration.
