        In this section, we list the changes what users should take into account before upgrading to Hazelcast 3.0 from
        earlier versions of Hazelcast.

                <para>
                    The static methods of Hazelcast class reaching hazelcast data components have been removed.
                    The functionality of these methods can be reached from HazelcastInstance interface.
                    Namely you should replace following:
                    <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
                    Map<Integer, String> mapCustomers = Hazelcast.getMap("customers");]]></programlisting>
                    with
                    <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
                    HazelcastInstance instance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(cfg);
                    // or if you already started an instance
                    // HazelcastInstance instance = Hazelcast.getHazelcastInstanceByName("instance1");
                    Map<Integer, String> mapCustomers = Hazelcast.getMap("customers");]]></programlisting>
                </para>

            <listitem>
                <emphasis role="bold">Removal of lite members:</emphasis>
                <para>
                    With 3.0 there will be no member type as lite member.
                    As 3.0 clients are smart client that they know in which node the data is located, you can replace your lite members with native clients.

                <para>
                    With 3.0 there will be no member type as lite member.
                    As 3.0 clients are smart client that they know in which node the data is located, you can replace your lite members with native clients.
