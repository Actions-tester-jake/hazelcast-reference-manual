    <title>Client Protocol Specification</title>
    <para>Hazelcast Client Protocol is a TCP protocol that is designed to be simple and yet powerful.
        A client opens a connection to Hazelcast server (default port is 5701) and sends the request command.
        Upon receiving the command, server will execute it and send the response back to the client. Each connection
        needs to send the protocol type first and then authenticate using AUTH command before sending any other command.
        After protocol is set and AUTH is done then the client can use the same connection to send infinite number of
        other commands over the same connection.
    </para>

    <para>
        <emphasis role="bold">Request Protocol</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
        General structure of protocol is as follows:
        <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
        COMMAND <arg1>…<argN> #M\r\n
        <s1>…<sM>\r\n
        B1B2…. BM\r\n]]></programlisting>

        Notice that the protocol consists of 3 lines. The first two lines are interpreted as text and there is a new
        line character after each. The first line is called "command line", second is "size line" and the rest is binary data.
    </para>

    <para>
        Command line specifies the command and some arguments for that command that can be defined as string.
        These are in general arguments like strings, boolean, integers and longs. The last argument defines the
        number of binary arguments. If there is no argument then it is ok to not provide it or one can simply provide #0.
        In case of #0 then next lines can be omitted. That is the client or server will only send the commandline as part
        of the protocol
    </para>
    <para>
        Size line defines the size of the binary arguments with space in between.
        This way server is able to parse the binary data.
    </para>

    <para>Here is a sample put command
        <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
        MPUT 0 myMap 0 #2
        5 7
        myKeymyValue]]></programlisting>

    </para>

    <para>
        <emphasis role="bold">Protocol common arguments</emphasis>

        In order to make life easier there are several common arguments. These are:

        <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>flag:
                    <literal>Flag is any string value that will be returned by server on answer.
                        Server doesn't care about the value that is set here. It will return it back on response object.
                        This argument can be used as call_id to match the responses to calls.
                        All commands have
                        <emphasis role="bold">flag</emphasis>
                        as the very first argument.
                    </literal>
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>noreply:
                    <literal>Is an optianal argument and is provied as it is, "noreply". If provided, server will not
                        send the
                        response back to client. Commands that retreive data from server do not have
                        <emphasis role="bold">noreply</emphasis>
                        as option.
                        Must be the last argument before
                        <emphasis role="bold">#N</emphasis> argument.

                    </literal>
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>name:
                    <literal>Is the name of the data structure. Distributed objects that require name must set this
                        argument accordingly.
                        Note that almost all commands do require it
                    </literal>
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
    </para>


    <para>
        <emphasis role="bold">Response</emphasis>
    </para>

    <para>
        Responses from server will use the same protocol. The command on response will either be
        <emphasis role="bold">OK</emphasis> or
        <emphasis role="bold">ERROR</emphasis>
        followed by <emphasis role="bold">flag</emphasis>.
    </para>

    <para>
        <emphasis role="bold">A status reply</emphasis>
    </para>

    <para>
        without any value will be

        <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
        OK <flag> \r\n
        ]]></programlisting>

       An error reply will be as follows:

        <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
        ERROR <flag> <error reason> \r\n
        ]]></programlisting>

        Error's will happen only if the request doesn't contain the proper arguments.
    </para>
