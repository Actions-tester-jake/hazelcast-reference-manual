    <title>Client Protocol Specification</title>
    <para> Hazelcast Client Protocol is a TCP protocol that is designed to be simple and yet powerful.
        A client opens a connection to Hazelcast server (default port is 5701) and send the request command.
        Upon receiving the command, server will execute it and send the response back to the client. Each connection needs to
        authenticate first using AUTH command.
    </para>

    <para>
        <emphasis role="bold">Request Protocol</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
        General structure of protocol is as follows:
        <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
        COMMAND <arg1>…<argN> \r\n
        #M  <s1>…<sM> \r\n
        B1B2…. BM]]></programlisting>

        Notice that the protocol consists of 3 lines. The first two lines are interpreted as text and there is a new line
        after each. The first line is called "command line", second is "size line" and the rest is binary data.
    </para>
    
    <para>
        Command line specifies the command and some arguments for that command that can be defined as string. 
        These are in general arguments like strings, booleans, integers and longs. 
    </para>
    <para>
        Size line defines the size of the binary arguments. It first states the number of binary arguments. Then size of each argument.
        This way server is able to parse the binary data.
    </para>
    
    <para> Here is a sample put command
    <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
        MPUT 0 myMap 0
        #2 5 7
        myKeymyValue]]></programlisting>

    </para>

    <para>
        <emphasis role="bold">Protocol common arguments</emphasis>
    </para>

    In order to make life easier there are several common arguments. These are:

    <para>
        <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>flag:
                    <literal>Flag is a long value that will be returned by server on answer.
                        Server doesn't care about the value that is set here. It will return it back on response object.
                        This argument can be used as call_id to match the responses to calls.
                        All commands have <emphasis role="bold">flag</emphasis> as the very first argument.</literal>
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>noreply:
                    <literal>Is an optianal argument and is provied as it is ("noreply"). If provided, server will not send the
                        response back to client. Commands that retreive data from server do not have
                        <emphasis role="bold">noreply</emphasis> as option.
                        Must be the last argument before <emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis>
                        (see the next argument for <emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis>) </literal>
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>end:
                    <literal> Is an optional argument and is provided as it is ("end").
                        If provided server will understand that there is no any binary argument thus,
                        there is no need to send size line. <emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis> argument can be used only if
                    there is 0 binary arguments. But note that it is not mandatory. One can skip it and send size line as follows:
                    "#0\r\n". Obviously there want be any binary data proceeding this line. If provided must be the last argument </literal>
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>name:
                    <literal> Is the name of the data structure. Distributed objects that require name must set this argument accordingly.
                        Note that almost all commands do require it</literal>
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
    </para>


    <para>
        <emphasis role="bold">Response</emphasis>
    </para>

    <para>
        Responses from server will use the same protocol. The command on response will either be <emphasis role="bold">OK</emphasis>
        <emphasis role="bold">ERROR</emphasis> followed by <emphasis role="bold">flag</emphasis>. 
        
    </para>

    <emphasis role="bold">A status reply </emphasis> without any value will be as follows:

    <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
        OK <flag>
        #0]]></programlisting>


    <emphasis role="bold">An error reply </emphasis> will be as follows:

    <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
        ERROR <flag> <error message>
        #0]]></programlisting>

    Error's will happen only if the request doesn't contain the proper arguments.
