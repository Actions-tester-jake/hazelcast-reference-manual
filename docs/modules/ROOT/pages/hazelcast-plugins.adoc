[[hazelcast-plugins]]

This chapter describes the plugins using which you can extend Hazelcast IMDG's functionalities.

[[hazelcast-cloud-discovery-plugins]]
== Cloud Discovery Plugins

Hazelcast provides the following plugins that allow Hazelcast cluster members to discover each other on the cloud platforms.
They are mainly used for the following reasons:

* provide dynamic member discovery when you do not want to or you cannot provide a list of static IP
addresses (for member-member discovery, client-member discovery, or WAN replication)
* enable resilience to availability zone failures (ZONE_AWARE feature)

[[hazelcast-cloud-discovery-plugins-aws]]
=== Hazelcast AWS

Hazelcast provides support for https://aws.amazon.com/[Amazon Web Services], covering the following environments:

* Amazon EC2 discovery with https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-aws[Hazelcast AWS Discovery plugin^]
* Amazon ECS/EC2 discovery with https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-aws[Hazelcast AWS Discovery plugin^]
* Amazon ECS/Fargate with https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-aws[Hazelcast AWS Discovery plugin^]
* Amazon EKS/Fargate with https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-kubernetes[Hazelcast Kubernetes Discovery plugin^]
* Amazon EKS/EC2 with https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-kubernetes[Hazelcast Kubernetes Discovery plugin^]

In all scenarios you can use the `ZONE_AWARE` feature to create partition backups in other Availability Zones (AZ)
and therefore prevent any data loss in case of AZ failures.

You can easily configure your Hazelcast member/client to use EC2/ECS discovery by having the `hazelcast-all`
(or `hazelcast-aws`) JAR on your classpath and enabling AWS in your Hazelcast configuration.

See the
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-aws[Hazelcast AWS Plugin documentation^]
for more details.

[[hazelcast-cloud-discovery-plugins-azure]]
=== Hazelcast Azure

Hazelcast provides support for https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/[Microsoft Azure^],
covering the following environments:

* Azure Virtual Machines with https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-azure[Hazelcast Azure Discovery plugin^]
* Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-kubernetes[Hazelcast Kubernetes Discovery plugin^]

In both scenarios you can use the `ZONE_AWARE` feature to create partition backups in other Availability Zones (AZ)
and therefore prevent any data loss in case of AZ failures.

You can easily configure your Hazelcast member/client to use Azure discovery by having the `hazelcast-all`
(or `hazelcast-azure`) JAR on your classpath and enabling Azure in your Hazelcast configuration.

See the
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-azure[Hazelcast Azure Plugin documentation^]

== Web Session Replication Plugins

You can use Hazelcast to replicate your web session in a number of environments.

=== Filter Based Web Session Replication

This plugin (a.k.a. Generic Web Session Replication) provides
HTTP session replication capabilities across a Hazelcast cluster in order to
handle failover cases. Assuming you have multiple web servers with load balancers;
if one server goes down, your users on that server are directed to one of
the other live servers, but their sessions are not lost. Using this plugin backs up
these HTTP sessions; it clusters them automatically.

See the https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-wm[Filter Based Web Session Replication documentation^]
for more details.

=== Tomcat Based Web Session Replication

Tomcat based web session replication is offered through Hazelcast Tomcat Session Manager.
It is a container specific module that enables session replication for
JEE Web Applications without requiring changes to the application.

See the following for more details:

* https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-tomcat-sessionmanager[Tomcat Based Web Session Replication documentation^]
* https://guides.hazelcast.org/springboot-tomcat-session-replication[Hazelcast Guides: Tomcat Session Replication with Spring Boot and Hazelcast^]

=== Jetty Based Web Session Replication

Jetty based web session replication is offered through Hazelcast Jetty Session Manager.
It is a container specific module that enables session replication for
JEE Web Applications without requiring changes to the application.

See the https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/configuring-sessions-hazelcast.html[Jetty: Persistent Sessions with Hazelcast^]
for more details.

== Framework Integration Plugins

Hazelcast provides the following integration plugins that
allow Hazelcast to integrate with other frameworks and applications.

=== Hazelcast Hibernate 2LC

http://hibernate.org/[Hibernate^] is an object-relational mapping tool for the Java programming language.
It provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a relational database and
enables developers to more easily write applications whose data outlives the application process.

https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-hibernate[Hazelcast Hibernate plugin^] provides Hazelcast's own distributed
second level cache implementation for your Hibernate entities, collections and queries.

To use this plugin, add the `hazelcast-all` (or `hazelcast-hibernate*`) dependency into your classpath.

See the following for more details:

* https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-hibernate[Hazelcast Hibernate Plugin documentation^].
* https://guides.hazelcast.org/springboot-hibernate/[Hazelcast Guides: Hibernate Second-Level Cache^]

=== Spring Boot

Hazelcast is very well integrated with the whole https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot^] ecosystem.
See the following resources for the details:

* https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-hazelcast[Spring Boot: Hazelcast^]

=== Spring Integration

https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration[Spring Integration^] provides an extension for Hazelcast.
It includes, but is not limited to, the following features:

* Event-driven inbound channel adapter: Listens related Hazelcast data structure events and
sends event messages to the defined channel.
* Continuous query inbound channel adapter: Listens the modifications performed on specific map entries.
* Cluster monitor inbound channel adapter:  Listens the modifications performed on the cluster.
* Distributed SQL inbound channel adapter: Runs the defined distributed SQL and returns
the results in the light of iteration type.
* Outbound channel adapter: Listens the defined channel and writes the incoming messages to
the related distributed data structure.
* Leader election: Elects a cluster member, for example, for highly available
message consumer where only one member should receive messages.

See the
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration-extensions/tree/master/spring-integration-hazelcast[Spring Integration Extension documentation^]
for more details.

=== Spring Data Hazelcast

https://spring.io/projects/spring-data[Spring Data^] provides
a consistent, Spring-based programming model for data access while
preserving the features of the underlying data store.

https://github.com/hazelcast/spring-data-hazelcast[Spring Data Hazelcast plugin^] provides an implementation
of the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-keyvalue[Spring Data Key Value^] abstraction, which
lets you use Hazelcast as the data store or a layer in between your application and the database.

See the
https://github.com/hazelcast/spring-data-hazelcast[Spring Data Hazelcast documentation^]
for more details.

=== Quarkus

Hazelcast integrates well with the https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus framework^]. What's more is that, if you use
the client/server topology, then Hazelcast client works in the GraalVM native executable mode. That means that
you can use Hazelcast in your super-fast native Docker images.

See the following resources for more details:

* https://github.com/hazelcast/quarkus-hazelcast-client[Hazelcast Client for Quarkus documentation^]
* https://guides.hazelcast.org/hazelcast-client-quarkus/[Hazelcast Guides: Hazelcast Client with Quarkus^]

See the following resources for more details:

* https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-cache/snapshot/guide/#hazelcast[Micronaut: Hazelcast Support^]
* https://guides.hazelcast.org/caching-micronaut/[Hazelcast Guides: Caching in Micronaut Microservices^]

=== Hazelcast JCA Resource Adapter

Hazelcast JCA Resource Adapter is a system-level software driver which
can be used by a Java application to connect to the Hazelcast cluster.
Using this adapter, you can integrate Hazelcast into Java EE containers.
After a proper configuration, Hazelcast can participate in the standard Java EE transactions.

See the
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-ra[Hazelcast JCA Resource Adapter documentation^]
for more details.

=== Hazelcast DynaCache

https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/linuxonibm/liaag/cache/pubwasdynacachoverview.htm[DynaCache^] by IBM is
used to store objects, and later, based on some data matching rules, to retrieve those objects and serve them from its cache.
This plugin is for Liberty Profile which is a lightweight profile of IBM WebSphere Application Server.

In the Liberty Profile, you can use a dynamic cache engine in order to cache your data.
With this plugin, you can use Hazelcast as a cache provider.

See the
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-dynacache[Hazelcast DynaCache documentation^]
for more details.

=== MuleSoft
