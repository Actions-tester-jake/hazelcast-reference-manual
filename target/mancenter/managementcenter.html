<p>Hazelcast Management Center enables you to monitor and manage your nodes running Hazelcast. In addition to monitoring overall state of your clusters, you can also analyze and browse your data structures in detail, update map configurations and take thread dump from nodes. With its scripting and console module, you can run scripts (JavaScript, Groovy, etc.) and commands on your nodes.</p>
<a name="installation"></a><h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<p>You have two options for installing Hazelcast Management Center. You can either deploy the <code>mancenter</code>-<em>version</em><code>.war</code> application into your Java application server/container or you can start Hazelcast Management Center from the command line and then have the Hazelcast nodes communicate with that web application. This means that your Hazelcast nodes should know the URL of the <code>mancenter</code> application before they start.</p>
<p>Here are the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the latest Hazelcast ZIP from <a href="http://www.hazelcast.org/download/" target="_blank">hazelcast.org</a>. The ZIP contains the <code>mancenter</code>-<em>version</em><code>.war</code> file. </li>
<li>You can directly start <code>mancenter</code>-<em>version</em><code>.war</code> file from the command line. The following command will start Hazelcast Management Center on port 8080 with context root &#39;mancenter&#39; (<code>http://localhost:8080/mancenter</code>).</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="lang-java">java -jar mancenter-*version*.war 8080 mancenter
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Or, you can deploy it to your web server (Tomcat, Jetty, etc.). Let us say it is running at <code>http://localhost:8080/mancenter</code>.</li>
<li>After you perform the above steps, make sure that <code>http://localhost:8080/mancenter</code> is up.</li>
<li>Configure your Hazelcast nodes by adding the URL of your web application to your <code>hazelcast.xml</code>. Hazelcast nodes will send their states to this URL.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="lang-xml">&lt;management-center enabled=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
  http://localhost:8080/mancenter
&lt;/management-center&gt;
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Start your Hazelcast cluster.</li>
<li>Browse to <code>http://localhost:8080/mancenter</code> and login. <strong>Initial login username/password is <code>admin/admin</code></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The Management Center creates a folder with the name &quot;mancenter&quot; under your &quot;user/home&quot; folder to save data files. You can change the data folder by setting the <code>hazelcast.mancenter.home</code> system property.</p>
<p><br></br></p>

<a name="tabbed-view"></a><h4 id="tabbed-view">Tabbed View</h4>
<p>Each time you select an item from the toolbar or menu, the item is added to the main view as a tab, as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="images/NonHMCTabbedView.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In the above example, <em>Home</em>, <em>Scripting</em>, <em>Console</em>, <em>queue1</em> and <em>map1</em> windows can be seen as tabs. Windows can be closed using the <img src="images/CloseIcon.jpg" alt=""> icon on each tab (except the Home Page; it cannot be closed).</p>
<a name="home-page"></a><h3 id="home-page">Home Page</h3>
<p>This is the first page appearing after logging in. It gives an overview of the connected cluster. The following subsections describe each portion of the page.</p>
<a name="cpu-utilization"></a><h4 id="cpu-utilization">CPU Utilization</h4>
<p>This part of the page provides load and utilization information for the CPUs for each node, as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="images/NonHMCCPUUtil.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The first column lists the nodes with their IPs and ports. The next columns list the loads on each CPU for the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes. The last column (<strong>Chart</strong>) graphically shows the utilization of CPUs. When you move the mouse cursor on a desired graph, you can see the CPU utilization at the time where the cursor is placed. Graphs under this column shows the CPU utilizations approximately for the last 2 minutes.</p>
<a name="memory-utilization"></a><h4 id="memory-utilization">Memory Utilization</h4>
<p>This part of the page provides information related to memory usages for each node, as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="images/NonHMCMemoryUtil.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The first column lists the nodes with their IPs and ports. The next columns show the used and free memories out of the total memory reserved for Hazelcast usage, in real-time. The <strong>Max</strong> column lists the maximum memory capacity of each node and the <strong>Percent</strong> column lists the percentage value of used memory out of the maximum memory. The last column (<strong>Chart</strong>) shows the memory usage of nodes graphically. When you move the mouse cursor on a desired graph, you can see the memory usage at the time where the cursor is placed. Graphs under this column shows the memory usages approximately for the last 2 minutes.</p>
<a name="memory-distribution"></a><h4 id="memory-distribution">Memory Distribution</h4>
<p>This part of the page graphically provides the cluster wise breakdown of memory, as shown below. The blue area is the memory used by maps, the dark yellow area is the memory used by non-Hazelcast entities, and the green area is the free memory out of the whole cluster`s memory capacity.</p>
<p><img src="images/Home-MemoryDistribution.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In the above example, you can see 0.32% of the total memory is used by Hazelcast maps (it can be seen by placing the mouse cursor on it), 58.75% is used by non-Hazelcast entities and 40.85% of the total memory is free.</p>
<a name="map-memory-distribution"></a><h4 id="map-memory-distribution">Map Memory Distribution</h4>
<p>This part is the breakdown of the blue area shown in the <strong>Memory Distribution</strong> graph explained above. It provides the percentage values of the memories used by each map, out of the total cluster memory reserved for all Hazelcast maps.</p>
<p><img src="images/Home-MapMemoryDistribution.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In the above example, you can see 49.55% of the total map memory is used by <strong>map1</strong> and 49.55% is used by <strong>map2</strong>.</p>
<a name="partition-distribution"></a><h4 id="partition-distribution">Partition Distribution</h4>
<p>This pie chart shows what percentage of partitions each node has, as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="images/Home-PartitionDistribution.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>You can see each node&#39;s partition percentages by placing the mouse cursor on the chart. In the above example, you can see the node &quot;127.0.0.1:5708&quot; has 5.64% of the total partition count (which is 271 by default and configurable, please see the <code>hazelcast.partition.count</code> property explained in the <a href="#system-properties">System Properties section</a>).</p>
<a name="caches"></a><h3 id="caches">Caches</h3>

<p><img src="images/timetravel.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>To see the cluster status in a past time, Time Travel should be enabled first. Click on the area where it says <strong>OFF</strong> (on the right of Time Travel window). It will turn to <strong>ON</strong> after it asks whether to enable the Time Travel with a dialog: click on <strong>Enable</strong> in the dialog to enable Time Travel.</p>
<p>Once it is <strong>ON</strong>, the status of your cluster will be stored on your disk as long as your web server is alive.</p>
<p>You can go back in time using the slider and/or calendar and check your cluster&#39;s situation at the selected time. All data structures and members can be monitored as if you are using the management center normally (charts and data tables for each data structure and members). Using the arrow buttons placed at both sides of the slider, you can go back or further with steps of 5 seconds. It will show status if Time Travel has been <strong>ON</strong> at the selected time in past; otherwise, all the charts and tables will be shown as empty.</p>
<p>The historical data collected with Time Travel feature are stored in a file database on the disk. These files can be found in the folder <code>&lt;User&#39;s Home Directory&gt;/mancenter&lt;Hazelcast version&gt;</code>, e.g. <code>/home/mancenter3.5</code>. This folder can be changed using the <code>hazelcast.mancenter.home</code> property on the server where Management Center is running.</p>
<p>Time travel data files are created monthly. Their file name format is <code>[group-name]-[year][month].db</code> and
 <code>[group-name]-[year][month].lg</code>. Time travel data is kept in the <code>*.db</code> files. The files with the extension <code>lg</code> are temporary files created internally and you do not have to worry about them.</p>
<p>Management Center has no automatic way of removing or archiving old time travel data files. They remain in the aforementioned folder until you delete or archive them.</p>
<a name="documentation"></a><h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>
